When you ask them why, the answer you almost always get is \"it's impossible for us to get a window of downtime to upgrade\". In today's world, where applications are required to be up literally 24/7, finding a window for upgrades is almost always an arduous task. This predicament has burdened organizations with outdated networks made up of unsupported hardware running unsupported software that is susceptible to who knows how many newly discovered security vulnerabilities. But there's no need to worry! Networking vendors have developed new innovations to seemlessly upgrade network infrastructure without having to worry about the typical downtime that comes along with it. Arista specifically has introduced MLAG ISSU (In-Service System Upgrade) and SSU (Smart System Upgrade). These upgrade methods allow for hitless network upgrades where packet loss is minimized and there is no disruption to users on the network. These innovations allow organizations to confidently keep their networks up-to-date while maintaining availability and further enhancing reliabilty.</p>"},{"location":"hitless-upgrades/hitless-upgrades-in-campus/#hitless-upgrade-mechanisms","title":"Hitless Upgrade Mechanisms","text":""},{"location":"hitless-upgrades/hitless-upgrades-in-campus/#mlag-issu","title":"MLAG ISSU","text":"<p>With MLAG (multi-chassis link aggregation), two physical switches are linked to form one logical switch which provides redundancy and resiliency.

This is to ensure that a switch undergoing a hitless upgrade will not cause a spanning tree topology change which could lead to a brief period of network downtime. In addition to this, SSU of the root bridge in a spanning tree topology will not be hitless unless the root bridge is a member of an MLAG pair where all devices connecting to the MLAG pair are dual homed. This way, a user can upgrade one side of the MLAG pair while the other side maintains spanning-tree state for the spanning tree topology.

This is because in normal operation when STP is in a restartable state for two switches in MLAG, the primary switch in the MLAG pair controls the STP operations. In order for MLAG failover to occur gracefully, the secondary switch in the MLAG pair must be aware of the STP state controlled by the primary. When STP is not restartable, that indicates that the current known STP state is stale. So if a reload of the primary switch in the MLAG pair were to occur while STP is not restartable, the secondary switch would not have an existing known spanning tree state to work off of when it assumes control and would therefore need to relearn the spanning-tree topology from scratch leading to a period of reconvergence and downtime.</p> <p>Starting in EOS 4.29.2F, if the STP agent is not in a restartable state, a warning message will appear when issuing the <code>show reload fast-boot</code> command or <code>reload fast-boot</code> command.</p> <pre><code>switch#show reload fast-boot\nWarnings in the current configuration detected:\nSTP is not currently restartable\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"hitless-upgrades/hitless-upgrades-in-campus/#non-edge-ports","title":"Non-Edge Ports","text":"<p>Root/Alternate Role SSU is only supported with spanning-tree enabled when all non-edge ports are in either root or alternate roles.</p> <p>The <code>show reload fast-boot</code> command will display a blocking reason if the non-edge ports are in a designated/backup role.</p> <pre><code>switch#show reload fast-boot\n'reload fast-boot' cannot proceed due to the following:\nOne or more non-edge ports are in spanning-tree designated/backup role\n</code></pre> <p>Bridge Assurance SSU is not supported with bridge assurance enabled on non-edge ports.</p> <p>The <code>show reload fast-boot</code> command will display a blocking reason if the non-edge ports are in a designated/backup role.</p> <pre><code>switch#show reload fast-boot\n'reload fast-boot' cannot proceed due to the following:\nTransmit active is enabled for one or more ports\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"hitless-upgrades/hitless-upgrades-in-campus/#pvstpvrst-and-mstp-interop","title":"PVST+/PVRST+ and MSTP Interop","text":"<p>PVRST+ seems to be the spanning-tree mode most prevalent in networks today. This poses a bit of a challenge in the context of SSU since the only mode of spanning-tree that can be run with SSU is MSTP. The good news though, is that it is possible for MSTP to interoperate with PVST+/PVRST+. In an interop scenario, outgoing Common Internal Spanning Tree (CIST) BPDUs coming from switches running PVST+/PVRST+ are projected as Rapid PVST+ BPDUs across various VLANs. When they hit a border port on a switch running MSTP, the incoming PVST+ topology BPDU is mapped to corresponding MSTI based on the incoming VLAN. So dumbing this down a bit, what happens is PVST+ BPDUs on the native vlan (VLAN1) will be used to interop with the MSTP MST0 instance. Therefore, it is important to allow VLAN 1 on any trunk interfaces between switches running PVST+/PVRST+ and switches running MSTP. If the design allows for it, it is also possible to make a switch running MSTP interoperating with a switch running PVST+/PVRST+ a MST/PVST border switch by applying the command <code>spanning-tree mst pvst border</code> on the MSTP switch. This does come with some restrictions though. These restrictions, as seen below, are relevant only for border ports with roles \u2018designated\u2019 or \u2018root\u2019 (for CIST) that can potentially forward. 1. If the MSTP-Rapid PVST+ border port role is \u2018designated\u2019 (for CIST), then it should not receive any superior Rapid PVST+ BPDU (with respect to CIST). Root of all VLANs in the Rapid PVST+ region should be towards the MSTP region. 2. If the MSTP-Rapid PVST+ border port role is \u2018root\u2019 (for CIST), then it should not receive any inferior Rapid PVST+ BPDU (with respect to CIST). Root of all VLANs in the Rapid PVST+ region should be within the PVST+ region.</p> <p>Note: If the restrictions are violated, the port enters \u2018blocking\u2019 state. The BPDU translation occurs only on MSTP-Rapid PVST+ border ports with the \u2018forwarding\u2019 state (for CIST). </p>"},{"location":"hitless-upgrades/hitless-upgrades-in-campus/#example-design","title":"Example Design","text":""},{"location":"hitless-upgrades/hitless-upgrades-in-campus/#topology","title":"Topology","text":"<p>Below is an example of a standard L2 campus topology. </p> <p>The MDF switches are an MLAG pair serving as the aggregation switches for the layer 2 domain.

Therefore, if you start the upgrade of the second switch in the MLAG before the reload delay timers expire, traffic will be lost.</p> <pre>\nswitch#show mlag\nMLAG Configuration:\ndomain-id                          :                MLAG\nlocal-interface                    :            Vlan4094\npeer-address                       :         169.254.0.1\npeer-link                          :    Port-Channel2000\npeer-config                        :          consistent\n\nMLAG Status:\nstate                               :      Active/Reload (0:04:37 left)\nnegotiation status                 :           Connected\npeer-link status                   :                  Up\nlocal-int status                   :                  Up\nsystem-id                          :   96:8e:d3:b3:dd:01\ndual-primary detection             :            Disabled\ndual-primary interface errdisabled :               False\n\nMLAG Ports:\nDisabled                           :                   0\nConfigured                         :                   0\nInactive                           :                   0\nActive-partial                     :                   1\nActive-full                        :                   0\n\nswitch#show interfaces status\nPort       Name                   Status       Vlan      Duplex Speed  Type         Flags Encapsulation\nEt1                               errdisabled  1         auto   auto   1000BASE-T\nEt2                               errdisabled  1         auto   auto   1000BASE-T\nEt3                               errdisabled  1         auto   auto   1000BASE-T\n...\nEt45                              errdisabled  1         auto   auto   1000BASE-T\nEt46                              errdisabled  1         auto   auto   1000BASE-T\nEt47       MLAG peer link member  connected    in Po2000 a-full a-1G   1000BASE-T\nEt48       MLAG peer link member  connected    in Po2000 a-full a-1G   1000BASE-T\nEt49                              errdisabled  1         full   10G    10GBASE-CR\nEt50                              errdisabled  1         full   10G    10GBASE-CR\n...\nEt53                              errdisabled  routed    full   10G    10GBASE-CR\nEt54                              errdisabled  1         full   25G    Not Present\nMa1                               connected    routed    a-full a-1G   10/100/1000\nPo2000     MLAG peer link         connected    trunk     full   2G     N/A\n</pre> <p>In the event that there is no layer 3 redundancy with the MDF MLAG pair, but all connected layer 2 devices are dual homed, it is possible to achieve a hitless upgrade by using SSU with Graceful Restart enabled. Some additional configuration is required though.</p> <p>Remember, during an SSU, the control plane does go down. However, by configuring Graceful Restart (GR) we can give the switch the ability to preserve its L3 forwarding state even while the control plane is down, allowing traffic to flow based on existing prefixes present in hardware. This is also known as non-stop forwarding. This aids upgrades and restarts to minimize L3 traffic loss.</p> <p>This can be configured for a switch running either BGP or OSPF.</p> <p>With BGP Graceful Restart (RFC 4724), traffic is forwarded based on existing prefixes and the switch notifies its BGP neighbors of this ability.  Once BGP has recovered, routing updates are sent to BGP neighbors to clear any stale entries.  </p> <pre><code>switch(config-router-bgp)# graceful-restart\nswitch(config-router-bgp)# graceful-restart grace-period 600\n</code></pre> <p>With OSPF Graceful Restart (RFC3623), an OSPF router stays on the forwarding path even as the OSPF software restarts.</p> <pre><code>switch(config-router-ospf)# graceful-restart\nswitch(config-router-ospf)# graceful-restart grace-period 600\n</code></pre> <p>Again, forwarding decisions are made based on the state of the forwarding table just prior to the device's control plane going offline. So if there are any changes/updates received from L3 peers while the control plane is down, those updates will not make their way into the down device's forwarding table and traffic loss may occur. Also keep in mind that there are a number of caveats and limitations running SSU. So it is always recommended to have redundancy at this layer so you can upgrade more reliably using MLAG ISSU. If you choose to upgrade L3 devices using SSU, just be aware that there is a greater risk of network impact.</p>"},{"location":"hitless-upgrades/hitless-upgrades-in-campus/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>There are so many new technologies that make upgrades easy and non-impactful. In this article, we discussed integrating these different mechanisms into different upgrade procedures using just the CLI. But these recipes can easily be automated with vendor specific or open source tools which allow for an even simpler upgrade experience. Considering this along with everything else we've discussed, upgrades should no longer be this scary thing everyone tries to avoid doing. While upgrades may have caused more trouble than good in the past, they should wind up saving you from trouble that comes from not upgrading going forward.</p>"},{"location":"hitless-upgrades/hitless-upgrades-in-campus/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>https://www.arista.com/en/um-eos/eos-multi-chassis-link-aggregation</li> <li>https://www.arista.com/en/um-eos/eos-smart-system-upgrade</li> <li>https://arista.my.site.com/AristaCommunity/s/article/Hitless-Upgrades-The-Whats-The-Whys-and-The-Hows</li> <li>https://arista.my.site.com/AristaCommunity/s/article/mlag-issu</li> <li>https://www.arista.com/en/um-eos/eos-spanning-tree-protocol</li> <li>https://www.arista.com/en/support/toi/eos-4-29-2f/17200-support-for-mstp-ssu-with-network-ports</li> <li>https://arista.my.site.com/AristaCommunity/s/question/0D52I00007ERqE2SAL/mlag-reloaddelay</li> </ul>"}]}
